# Protopad Markdown Editor
This application combines the findings from two earlier prototype projects: proto-gctr and proto-dmd. The functionality includes the editing and preview of markdown notes.

## Project Summary

This project is a web-based markdown editor built with Go and HTMX, offering a seamless and interactive editing experience. The application allows users to write and edit markdown content, which is then dynamically rendered into HTML for immediate preview. 

### Key Features:

- **Real-time Markdown Rendering**: Utilizes HTMX for instant preview of markdown content as HTML. Markdown functionality is from the [Go Markdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) package. 
- **Go Backend**: Leverages the power and efficiency of Go for server-side operations.
- **Export Functionality**: Enables users to export their rendered content as PDF documents.
- **Web-based Interface**: Accessible through any modern web browser, no installation required.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent user experience across devices.

This application serves as an efficient tool for content creators, developers, and anyone who needs a straightforward yet powerful markdown editing solution. Whether you're drafting documentation, writing blog posts, or preparing content for web publication, this editor streamlines the process from writing to final output.
